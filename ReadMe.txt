I made that the admin can only create, modify, delete a service Type. 
For the hourly rate, the service provider will be the one choosing. It is making more sense in that way. Since different service provider of the same service type could have different price. 
If I see that I can't free will my app for that I will change it back that admin can modify the hourly rate aswell.
